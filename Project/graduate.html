<h3 class="secondHeader">Program: MS (Master of Science) in CSE</h3>
<hr />
<p>There are two semesters in the MS program, Semester A (July-December session) and Semester B (January-June Session). The MS program of CSEDU runs in Open-credit policy and a student must complete 36 credit hours to achieve the MS degree. However, there are two groups in the MS program:</p>
<ol class="lowerRoman">
<li><b>Thesis group: </b> students of this group require completing 18 credit course work and a thesis of 18 credits.</li>
<li><b>Project group: </b> students of this group require to complete 30 credit course work along with a 6 credit project work.</li>
</ol>
<p>A student can take a minimum 6 credit hours and a maximum of 12 credit hours in each semester. However, in case where most of the courses are completed, he/she can take less than 6 credit hours in a semester. Further, a student must earn the degree within 6 semesters while theory courses must be finished in the first three semesters. In that scenario, students can take readmission for submitting the thesis only and his/her marks in the theory courses will remain unchanged.</p>
<h3 class="secondHeader">Degree of Master of Science(MS) by open credit (credit selection by choice)<br />
Part &#8211; I: General</h3>
<hr />
<ol class="numeric">
<li><b>Degree Objectives</b>
<ol class="upperAlpha">
<li>The Master of Science degree will be offered in two types:
<ol class="lowerRoman">
<li>Master of Science by Coursework (MS by Coursework)</li>
<li>Master of Science by Research (MS by Research)</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>After completing the MS by Coursework degree successfully, an individual is expected to have advanced knowledge and/or professional practice in various technologies or fields of study related to the Computer Science and Engineering.</li>
<li>After completing the MS by Research degree successfully, an individual is expected to have advanced knowledge in a specific or multidisciplinary /interdisciplinary field and higher order skills in research, investigation, analysis and critical evaluation.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Enrollment Requirement</b><br />
As per rule of the University of Dhaka, mentioned in <a href="?page_id=5615#ms">Admission section</a>.</li>
<li><b>Period of Study: Academic Semesters</b>
<ol class="upperAlpha">
<li>The academic program for the Master of Science degree will run on semester basis.</li>
<li>There will be two regular semesters in an academic year of the University. The first regular semester (Semester-A) of an academic year starts on the first day of July. The second regular semester (Semester-B) starts on the first day of January.</li>
<li>A regular semester would be a period of 6 months, for a coursework of both types of degrees, all classroom activities (i.e., class room lectures, class tests, laboratory works, tutorials, and in-course assessments will be held within the first 15 active weeks.</li>
<li>An interested student may apply for admission in any of the regular semesters and if s/he is allowed to get admission s/he has to complete the degree requirements within 6 (six) regular Semesters counting from the semester of his/her admission.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Degree Requirement</b>
<ol class="upperAlpha">
<li>To be awarded a degree in any of the MS program, a student will require completing a minimum of 36 credits. The details of minimum requirement for the degree types are described in <a href="#part3">Part III</a> and <a href="#part4">Part IV</a>.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Course Selection</b>
<ol class="upperAlpha">
<li>A student, by his/her own choice, will have to register his/her courses in a semester among the courses offered at that semester for partial fulfilment of degree requirement. However, if there is any prerequisite course for a course offered then those students who have completed the prerequisite course successfully can register to the offered course.</li>
<li>There will be a minimum and a maximum limit of registering courses by a student in a semester. (For details check <a href="#part3">Part III</a> and <a href="#part4">Part IV</a>).</li>
<li>In special circumstances, if it deems to the thesis/project supervisor of a student that a course(s) is required by the student for his/her the thesis/project advise and that will be binding for the students.</li>
<li>In special circumstances, if the number of student registered in a course is less than the required minimum number of students in a coursework, the academic committee of the department may cancel the offered course for the semester. In such a case, the students who have registered to the course may choose and register from other available courses.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Enrollment and Drop-out of a Student</b>
<ol class="upperAlpha">
<li>A student who is admitted to a master program would be considered as a regular student up to next available 6 semesters including the current one. Until completion of his/her degree he /she has to enroll him/herself for each semester. Additionally he/she has to register himself/herself for the required course(s).</li>
<li>A student will be allowed to enroll for the 4th semester only when he/she leaves the residential status of the hall. He/she must show a hall clearance certificate issued by hall provost before starting the enrollment procedure for 4th semester. He/she must not be a resident student after his/her 3rd semester starting from the first enrollment.</li>
<li>A student will be considered as &#8220;dropped&#8221; automatically, if he/she does not enroll him/herself before completing required minimum credits. An automatic drop-out will occur after one month of the start date of that semester.</li>
<li>If a student is dropped automatically as per article 6.3, s/he may apply for reactivation of his/her admission before the enrollment period for the next semester. The academic committee of the department may accept or reject his/her application for reactivation in the following semester.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><b>Evaluation</b>
<ol class="upperAlpha">
<li>In each Semester there will be an Examination Committee (referred to as EC). There will be chairman and three members in the EC. One of the members must be from outside the department.</li>
<li>The course teachers, the thesis/project evaluation committee members or any examiners will submit evaluation reports/mark-sheet to the EC.</li>
<li>Two tabulators will tabulate separately all received marks and/or grades obtained by all students of a semester.</li>
<li>After finalizing and signing the tabulation sheets, no information of the tabulation sheets can be altered based on student&#8217;s achievements in his/her next semesters. Alternation of marks/grades in a tabulation sheet can be made only if an error is detected and proper channel is maintained.</li>
<li>The EC will submit two copies of the tabulation sheets to the office of the controller of examination of the University for publishing the results.</li>
<li>A student will get a grade sheet from the office of the controller of examination summarizing the grade points and grades obtained for each course and a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) up to the semester.</li>
<li>In computing the CGPA of a student, the tabulators will collect all the academic records of the student from the previous tabulation sheets.
<ol class="lowerRoman">
<li>Final Result: CGPA = ΣG<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub>÷ΣC<sub>i</sub>, where, G<sub>i</sub> is the grade point obtained in course i and C<sub>i</sub> is the corresponding credit. If any student get F grade in his/her thesis/project/any of the courses then his/her result will not be published. A student will be considered as passed if his/her CGPA is at least 2.50 or more.</li>
